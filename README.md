1. Headline KPIs (Top Right)
•	KPIs: These cards show the high-level totals for the selected period (Year 24).
o	Savings (73.95K): Total amount saved.
o	Income (163K): Total money earned.
o	Expense (89.25K): Total money spent.
o	Target (0.60): The desired savings rate, likely 60%.
•	Conclusion & Action: The current savings rate (Savings ÷ Income) is 45.3%, which is significantly below the 60% target. This indicates a need to either increase income or decrease expenses to reach the goal.

2. Expense by Component (Donut Chart)
•	KPI: The percentage breakdown of total spending by category.
•	Conclusion & Action: Over 62% of all expenses are consumed by just two categories: House Rent (35.85%) and EMIs (26.89%). These are large, fixed costs.
•	Action: Since major expenses are fixed, cutting discretionary spending (like shopping or travel) will have a limited impact. To make significant progress toward the savings target, the user must focus on a long-term strategy to reduce fixed costs, such as refinancing loans (EMIs) or finding more affordable housing.

3. Savings by Component (Donut Chart)
•	KPI: The proportional contribution of each income source to the total savings amount.
•	Conclusion & Action: The primary income source, Salary, is responsible for nearly 93% of all savings. The secondary source, Freelancing, contributes very little.
•	Action: The most effective way to boost savings from the income side is to grow the freelance business. Increasing this secondary income stream would directly accelerate progress toward the 60% savings target without impacting the fixed salary.

4. Savings Trend (Area Chart)
•	KPI: The trend of total savings over time (month_year).
•	Conclusion & Action: The chart currently shows a steep decline in savings from one point in time to another (Note: the x-axis appears to be sorted incorrectly, but it still indicates a drop).
•	Action: This is a major warning sign. The user needs to immediately investigate why their savings are being depleted. The other charts suggest this is due to expenses being too high relative to the savings target.

5. Summary Table
•	KPI: A detailed, itemized list of the exact values for every income and expense category.
•	Conclusion & Action: This table provides the raw data that feeds all the other visuals, showing exact figures like 32K for House Rent and 151.2K for Salary.
•	Action: This table is the foundation for detailed budgeting and planning. It allows the user to move beyond percentages and set specific, actionable goals (e.g., "I will reduce my 'Shopping' expense from 5,000 to 4,000 next month").


Overall Conclusion
The user has a strong income and savings habit, saving approximately 45.3% of their income. However, they are not meeting their 60% savings target. The primary barriers are high fixed expenses (rent and EMIs) and a heavy reliance on a single income source for savings.
