•	Situation: The management team lacked a centralized, real-time view of the company's financial health, relying on static, manually compiled Excel reports that were time-consuming and prone to errors

•	Task: To design and process a dynamic, end-to-end Power BI dashboard that would automate financial reporting and provide actionable insights into the company's Profit & Loss (P&L), Balance Sheet, and cash flow performance.

•	Action: Connected to and transformed raw data from multiple sources (Excel, CSV) using Power Query, performing data cleaning, shaping, and creating a robust financial data model. Implemented slicers and drill-through functionality to empower non-technical users to perform self-service analysis by product category, region, and time period.

•	Result: Reduced the time spent on manual reporting by over 95% (e.g., from 10 hours per month to under 30 minutes).
Enabled senior management to monitor financial performance in near real-time, leading to 15% faster identification of key trends and budget variances.
